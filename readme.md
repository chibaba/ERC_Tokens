# For this project, we'll be creating one fungible and one non-fungible token. Our fungible token will be a payment token called chibabaCoin. Our non-fungible token will be an apartment ownership token called Condos. We'll also be creating a wallet that can hold both fungible and non-fungible tokens.

## We will be using Truffle Suite and the Ganache blockchain for building and deploying our smart contracts. For writing our smart contract, we'll be using the OpenZeppelin Solidity library version 2.2. OpenZeppelin is a nifty resource that provides smart contract templates for developing DApps. It is a suite of tested and community-approved smart contracts that can be used as building blocks for production-grade blockchain applications.

## The OpenZeppelin framework consists of reusable contract code for Ethereum and other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains (for example, Quorum). It significantly cuts down the development time for building secure and safe blockchain applications and the time for writing smart contracts. It also helps to promote standardization.
